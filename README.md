Supercon 2024 SAO Code and Design

Code diretory contains micropython both code for the badge and for a XIAO 2040 if you choose to run the 
SAO without the badge. 

Due to design issues, the SAO will not work if it is powered from the badge with the XIAO attached, i.e.
you can't run code from the XIAO while using the badge for power. If you want to run the SAO from the XIAO,
run the power through the USB C port on the XIAO.
