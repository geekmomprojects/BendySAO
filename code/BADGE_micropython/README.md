I need to upload better code to integrate with the badge, but for now, to get the Bendy SAO working from the badge, add the files in the "lib" folder to the "lib" folder on the badge, and insert the code in main.py into main.py on the badge. The code assumes that Bendy SAO is on badge port 1, but that is easily changed in the code.
